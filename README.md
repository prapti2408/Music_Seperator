Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered web application designed to separate a song into two distinct audio tracks: vocals and background music. It addresses a common problem faced by singers and music enthusiasts who struggle to find clean instrumental versions of songs online. By allowing users to upload any audio file and process it locally using AI models, the application provides a reliable and high-quality alternative for singing practice and music analysis.
